# Frontend Context — Saigon Food & Coffee Finder

> **Product scope, screens, design tokens and release order** come from `src/docs/` and
> `README.md`; those are the source of truth for _what_ to build.
> **Library choices** come from `package.json`; it is the source of truth for _what with_.
> Where the two disagree, see §"Stack reconciliation" — the docs' `[STACK]` block explicitly
> permits substitution, so the installed stack wins and the docs' intent is preserved.

## Role

A mobile-first React SPA for discovering restaurants (quán ăn) and cafés (cà phê) in Ho Chi
Minh City. Bilingual VI (default) / EN, light + dark, installable as a PWA.

The core job: **help someone find a place to eat or drink right now.** Every scope decision
is settled by asking whether it serves that sentence.

Target viewport 390×844, must work 360–430px. **Phone only until R3** — but the root is
fluid (`max-width: 480px`, centred on larger screens), never a hard-coded 390px.

Previously this frontend was auth-only. That work is done and still stands (cookie session,
CSRF, `/login`), but it is now **supporting infrastructure** for Saved and Add-a-place, not
the product. See §"Auth" below.

## Source docs

| File                                    | Use it for                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`                             | Screen inventory (21 artboards), build order summary      |
| `src/docs/01-implementation-prompt.md`  | Phase-by-phase build plan, design tokens, data contracts  |
| `src/docs/04-mobile-screen-priority.md` | Screen ranking, R1/R2/R3 slices, phone rules, sprint plan |

⚠️ **Two referenced docs do not exist on disk.** `README.md` indexes four files; only `01`
and `04` are present:

- `02-component-breakdown.md` — component tree, props, state ownership, **i18n keys**.
  Phase 1 says to take the VI/EN copy from it. Until it lands, i18n keys are invented at the
  call site and must be reconciled later.
- `03-database-analysis.md` — entities, schema, **the API contract**. The `IPlace` /
  `SearchQuery` types in `01` are the only contract we have; everything else is mocked.

Do not invent an API contract and present it as settled. Mock it, keep mocks in one place,
and mark the boundary.

## Stack reconciliation

The docs describe a greenfield stack; this repo already has a committed, working one. The
docs' `[STACK]` block says _"Replace the `[STACK]` block if you use a different stack"_, so
the installed library wins on every row below. The **design intent** of each doc row is kept.

| Concern   | Docs say                    | We use (installed)                 | How intent is preserved                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React     | 18                          | **19.3**                           | No API in the docs needs 18                                                       |
| UI        | no UI kit, CSS Modules      | **shadcn/ui (radix-nova) + TW 4**  | Retokenise the primitives to the palette below                                    |
| App state | Zustand                     | **Zustand** (`store/search-store`) | Matches the docs; server state still lives in TanStack Query                      |
| Theming   | `data-theme="dark"` on html | **next-themes** writing `.dark`    | Same tokens, different attribute; see §Theming                                    |
| Font      | Be Vietnam Pro              | **Geist** (`@fontsource-variable`) | Swap to Be Vietnam Pro when VI diacritics are reviewed — it is the better VI face |
| Icons     | inline stroke SVG, 24px     | **lucide-react**                   | Lucide is 24px stroke; matches. **No emoji in UI** either way                     |
| Map (R2)  | MapLibre GL / Google Maps   | not installed                      | Decide at R2; lazy-load as its own chunk                                          |
| PWA (R2)  | `vite-plugin-pwa`           | not installed                      | Add at R2, not before                                                             |
| i18n      | `i18next`, vi + en          | **i18next + react-i18next**        | Installed in phase 1; `en.ts` is typed against `vi.ts`                            |

Unresolved and deliberately so: the **map SDK choice**. Cheap to defer; it does not block R1.

## Stack & libraries

- React 19 + Vite + TypeScript (strict)
- `react-router-dom` v7 (data router: `createBrowserRouter` + `RouterProvider`)
- `@tanstack/react-query` — all **server** state
- `zustand` — the one piece of global **client** state (`SearchQuery`)
- `axios` (shared instance with the auth/CSRF interceptor)
- `tailwindcss` v4 (CSS-first; no `tailwind.config.ts`) + shadcn/ui (style `radix-nova`)
- `next-themes` (theme class), `sonner` (toasts), `vaul` (drawers → bottom sheets)
- `i18next` + `react-i18next` — VI default, EN peer; `i18n/en.ts` is typed against `vi.ts`
  so a missing translation is a compile error

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev           # http://localhost:5173 (API on :9999)
pnpm build         # tsc -b (type gate) then vite build → dist/
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test          # vitest (format/normalize helpers must be covered)
```

## Routes

Sheets are **overlay state, not routes** (optionally mirrored to `?sheet=`). Only these are
real routes:

| Path          | Screen         | Release | Notes                                 |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/`           | Discover       | R1      | Card list; also hosts table/map views |
| `/place/:id`  | Place detail   | R1      | No bottom nav                         |
| `/saved`      | Saved          | R2      | Needs a session or device id          |
| `/account`    | Account        | R2      | Language, theme, default location     |
| `/add`        | Add a place    | R2      | No bottom nav; 3 steps at ≤360px      |
| `/login`      | LoginPage      | done    | Outside the auth gate                 |
| `/onboarding` | OnboardingPage | done    | After a sign-up                       |
| `*`           | NotFoundPage   | done    |                                       |

In R1 the bottom nav shows Discover active; Map / Saved / Account are hidden or disabled with
"Sắp ra mắt / Coming soon".

**Browsing does not require sign-in.** `RequireAuth` must wrap only `/saved`, `/account` and
`/add` — never `/` or `/place/:id`. Gating Discover would break the core job.

## Design tokens

CSS variables on `:root`, redefined for dark. These are **the** palette — do not introduce
ad-hoc colours, and retokenise `components/ui/` rather than hard-coding hexes in components.

| Token                    | Light                 | Dark                  | Use                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--bg`                   | `#FBF7F2`             | `#16110E`             | app background                |
| `--surface`              | `#FFFFFF`             | `#221A15`             | cards, sheets, nav            |
| `--surface-2`            | `#F3EBE3`             | `#2E241D`             | inputs, segmented tracks      |
| `--ink`                  | `#2B1D15`             | `#F4EAE2`             | primary text                  |
| `--ink-2`                | `#6A5446`             | `#C4B1A3`             | secondary text                |
| `--ink-3`                | `#CDBCAF`             | `#5E4D42`             | decorative (unused ₫, dashes) |
| `--line`                 | `#E8DDD3`             | `#3B2F27`             | borders, dividers             |
| `--primary`              | `#B4532F`             | `#E8906A`             | terracotta: buttons, active   |
| `--on-primary`           | `#FFFFFF`             | `#1B0F09`             | text on primary               |
| `--tint` / `--tint-ink`  | `#F7E4DA` / `#8C3C1E` | `#3C271D` / `#F6B898` | selected chips                |
| `--open` / `--open-tint` | `#1D7A4C` / `#E2F2E8` | `#66CC98` / `#173220` | "Đang mở / Open"              |
| `--star`                 | `#C27A12`             | `#F0B24A`             | star icon                     |
| `--scrim`                | `rgba(28,18,12,.48)`  | `rgba(0,0,0,.62)`     | sheet backdrop                |
| `--skel`                 | `#EDE3D9`             | `#2F261F`             | skeleton blocks               |

Radii: chips `999px`, inputs/buttons `12–14px`, cards `16px`, sheets `22px` (top only).
Shadows soft and warm: `0 6px 18px rgba(60,35,20,.08)`.
Spacing scale: `4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24`. Page side padding `16px`. Body text `15px/1.4`.

## Theming

The docs specify `data-theme="dark"` on `<html>`; `next-themes` is already wired to write the
`.dark` class that the generated `radix-nova` variant expects. **Keep `.dark`** — switching to
`data-theme` would mean re-generating every `components/ui/` file for no visual gain.

R1 ships light only. R2 adds the Account toggle (Sáng | Tối) — note this **changes** the old
auth-era rule of "follow `prefers-color-scheme`, no toggle": `defaultTheme="system"` stays the
default, but an explicit user choice must now persist and win.

## i18n — the rule that touches every component

**Every string goes through i18n. No hard-coded copy in components.** VI is the default
locale; EN is a full peer, not a fallback.

1. **Place names are never translated** — Nguyễn Huệ, Phường Xuân Hòa, Bình Thạnh. District
   _labels_ may translate ("Quận 3" ↔ "District 3").
2. **Dish names stay Vietnamese.** In EN mode append a hint: `Cơm tấm · broken rice`.
3. Locale formatting lives in `lib/format.ts`, never inline:

   | Helper                 | vi        | en         |
   | ---------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
   | `formatVnd(45000)`     | `45.000₫` | `45,000₫`  |
   | `formatDecimal(4.7)`   | `4,7`     | `4.7`      |
   | `formatDistance(1200)` | `1,2 km`  | `1.2 km`   |
   | `formatTime('22:30')`  | `22:30`   | `10:30 PM` |

   Each helper is unit-tested in both locales. This is the one place tests are mandatory.

4. `lib/normalize.ts` → `normalizeVi(s)`: lower-case, NFD-strip diacritics, `đ`→`d`. Used for
   search and duplicate checks. Test: `normalizeVi('Phường Võ Thị Sáu') === 'phuong vo thi sau'`.
5. **VI and EN string lengths differ a lot.** Everything truncates with an ellipsis or wraps;
   nothing overflows horizontally. Check both locales at 360px.

⚠️ This supersedes the auth-era rule "UI text is in English". Error copy lives in the i18n
resources, not in `lib/errors.ts`. The backend still replies in Vietnamese; always render
`messageFor(err)`, never `err.message`.

## Error codes

Codes are **numbers**, formatted `HTTP status x100 + sequence`. A number is a stable,
language-independent token, so the i18n key _is_ the code — there is no name-to-number
table to keep in sync, and adding a locale means adding copy, never touching the contract.

```ts
// types/api.ts — one numeric space, so a code is unambiguous wherever it appears
const ERROR_CODE = {
  // JSON body: { error: { code, message } }
  VALIDATION_ERROR: 40001,
  UNAUTHENTICATED: 40101,
  FORBIDDEN: 40301, // also a rejected CSRF token
  RATE_LIMITED: 42901,
  INTERNAL: 50001,
};

const LOGIN_ERROR = {
  // the callback redirect's ?error= param
  CANCELLED: 40102,
  LOGIN_FAILED: 40103,
  FORBIDDEN: 40302, // the Google account is not allowed
  SERVER_ERROR: 50002,
};
```

Copy lives under `apiError.<code>` and `loginError.<code>` in `i18n/{vi,en}.ts`, with the
constant's name in a trailing comment — `40101` alone tells a translator nothing. `en.ts` is
typed against `vi.ts`, so a code with no translation fails `pnpm typecheck`.

Rules:

- **Never branch on a code's number in a component.** Compare against `ERROR_CODE.X`.
- `ERROR_CODE` and `LOGIN_ERROR` must not collide — one space, unique sequences.
- An unmodelled code degrades to `INTERNAL` rather than rendering a missing key. Adding a
  backend code without adding copy here is therefore silent; add both.
- API codes arrive as **JSON numbers**. A code sent as the string `"40101"` is rejected and
  degrades to `INTERNAL`.
- `?error=` is a URL param and always a string, so `parseLoginErrorCode` coerces it. It is
  untrusted input: anything non-numeric or unmodelled yields `null` and no banner renders.

⚠️ **Both sets need the Go backend to emit numbers.** Until it does, `/api` errors all show
the generic INTERNAL copy, and `?error=cancelled` renders no banner at all. Confirm the five
API values against the Go `ErrorCode` enum before relying on them — they were derived from
the documented HTTP status mapping, not read off the handlers.

## Mobile-web rules (apply from R1)

- Viewport `width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover`. Without
  `viewport-fit=cover`, `env(safe-area-inset-*)` resolves to `0px`.
- Full-height screens use `100dvh` / `min-h-dvh`, never `100vh`.
- `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding on the bottom nav, sheet footers, sticky bars and the
  spin button. Plain `env()` is `0px` on a non-notched device, so use
  `max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`.
- **Every `<input>` / `<textarea>` is 16px**, even where the design shows 15px — iOS Safari
  zooms in below that.
- Keep focused inputs above the keyboard: `scrollIntoView({block:'center'})` plus the
  `visualViewport` resize event to lift sticky footers.
- Tap targets ≥ 44×44px with ≥ 8px between them. The Nova button primitive is 32–36px, so
  override with `size-11` / `h-11` rather than editing `components/ui/`.
- `touch-action: manipulation`. **No hover-only affordances** — hover styles only inside
  `@media (hover: hover)`.
- Primary actions sit in the **lower half** of the screen (sheet footers, sticky bars).
- Geolocation only after a user tap, never on load; HTTPS required; fall back to the manual
  location cascade.
- On scroll, the Discover header collapses (location + search rows hide) while the filter/sort
  toolbar stays sticky — cards should get ~70% of the screen.

### Bottom sheets

All panels (location, filters, sort, lucky spin) are bottom sheets, built on `vaul`:
drag handle, scrim that closes on tap, `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, focus trapped
inside, `overscroll-behavior: contain`, body scroll locked while open, swipe down to close,
animations under 250ms. Confirmations use a sheet, never `window.confirm`.

## Accessibility

- Real `<button>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<a>` elements. Icon-only buttons need `aria-label`.
- Toggles use `aria-pressed`; tabs use `role="tab"` + `aria-selected`; the results table uses
  `role="table|row|columnheader|rowheader|cell"` + `aria-sort`.
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA) in **both** themes.
- Result counts are `aria-live="polite"`; the spin result is `role="status"`.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — the spin skips straight to its result.
- Tab order is logical; sheets trap focus; axe reports no serious violations.
- Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

## Performance budget

**≤ 170 KB gzipped initial JS** (tightened from the auth-era 200 KB), LCP < 2.5s on a
mid-range Android over 4G. Measure, do not estimate:

```bash
pnpm build && gzip -c dist/assets/index-*.js | wc -c
```

Lazy-load the map SDK (R2) and the lucky spin (R3) as separate chunks. Images via `srcset` +
WebP/AVIF with blurhash placeholders.

⚠️ The current build is **183 KB gzipped** — already over the 170 KB budget before any
product code exists. Trim before adding the map or spin chunks.

## Data contracts

**Wire format is `snake_case`, and the TypeScript types mirror it exactly.** There is no
transform layer: what the backend sends is what components read, so `place.avg_price_per_person`
is the field name everywhere. Keep it that way — adding a camelCase mapping for some
endpoints and not others is how two conventions end up in one codebase.

React props, local state, store internals and i18n keys stay **camelCase**; they never cross
the wire. Only fields that appear in a JSON payload are snake_case.

Mock these first; the real API is specified in the missing `03-database-analysis.md`.

```ts
type Category = 'food' | 'cafe';

interface IPlace {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: Category;
  rating: number | null;
  review_count: number;
  price_level: 1 | 2 | 3;
  avg_price_per_person: number; // VND
  distance_m: number;
  street: string;
  area_id: string;
  is_open: boolean;
  closes_at?: string;
  opens_at?: string;
  is_24h: boolean;
  cover_photo_url?: string;
  cover_caption?: string;
  tags: string[]; // tag keys, e.g. 'work','wifi','aircon'
  cuisine?: string | null; // 'pho','bun','comtam',...
  status: 'approved' | 'pending';
  is_saved: boolean;
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
}

interface SearchQuery {
  category: 'all' | Category;
  area_id?: string;
  ward_id?: string;
  street_id?: string;
  filters: {
    tag_keys: string[];
    price_levels: number[];
    cuisines: string[];
    openNow: boolean;
    openLate: boolean;
    open24h: boolean;
    radius_m?: 500 | 1000 | 3000 | 5000;
    min_rating?: 3.5 | 4 | 4.5;
  };
  sort:
    | 'relevant'
    | 'nearest'
    | 'rating'
    | 'price_asc'
    | 'price_desc'
    | 'newest'
    | 'name'
    | 'open_first';
}

// Cursor pagination, generic over the row type (types/api.ts).
interface CursorPage<T> {
  items: T[];
  next_cursor: string | null; // null is the only end-of-list signal
  total: number | null; // null when the backend declines to count
}

interface ICursorParams {
  cursor?: string;
  limit?: number;
}

type PlaceCursorPage = CursorPage<IPlace>;
```

**The cursor is not part of `SearchQuery`.** The doc's contract lists it there, but it is
pagination state, not search state: folding it into the TanStack Query key would give every
page its own cache entry instead of appending pages to one list. `fetchPlaces(query, params)`
takes it separately, and `usePlaces` passes it as the `pageParam`.

Cursors are **opaque**. Never compute or compare one in the client — an offset would shift
when rows are inserted mid-scroll and the user would see duplicates or gaps.

Scroll-to-fetch is `withCursorPagination(useQueryHook)(ListView)`, which injects `items`,
`total`, `hasMore`, `isFetchingMore`, `sentinelRef` and `retry`. Attach `sentinelRef` to an
element at the end of the list; it is a callback ref, so it survives the list unmounting
between its loading, empty and error branches.

**One `SearchQuery` is the single source of truth for results.** Quick chips, active chips,
the filter sheet, the sort sheet and the table headers all read and write the _same_ state.
Any second copy drifts and the UI starts lying about what is filtered.

Endpoints the UI needs (shape unconfirmed): `GET /places`, `GET /places/count` (live filter
count, debounce 250ms), `GET /locations/search?q=`, `GET /places/duplicates?name=&lat=&lng=`
(debounce 300ms), `POST /place-submissions`, `POST /events`.

## Release slices

Build R1 first, and only the R1 parts of mixed phases.

**R1 — "Find a place near me" (MVP).** Flow: open → set location → browse cards →
filter/sort → open a place → get directions.
Discover cards, category tabs, quick + active chips; filter / sort / location sheets; detail
with media grid and "Chỉ đường"; loading, empty and end-of-list states; bottom nav; VI/EN
toggle; light theme.
_Hidden in R1:_ lucky spin, "Thêm quán mới" CTA, the table and map view toggles.

**R2 — "Come back and contribute."** Saved, Account, dark theme; map view; media viewer;
add-a-place with moderation; PWA install + offline cache.

**R3 — "Delight and power."** Lucky spin (weighted by R1–R2 usage), table view, tablet and
desktop layouts.

Phase order within R1: `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 10a`.

### Responsive, R3 only

- ≥768px: nav becomes a left rail, cards 2-up, filter sheet becomes a 380px right panel, sort
  becomes a dropdown.
- ≥1200px: persistent filter sidebar, cards 3-up, 40/60 list|map split with hover-linked
  pins, full table without horizontal scroll.

## Auth

Unchanged and working — it is just no longer the whole app. Full detail in git history; the
rules that still bind:

- ⚠️ `User.avatar_url` was renamed from `avatarUrl` (2026-10-21) ahead of the Go change.
  **The header avatar renders blank until the backend ships snake_case on `/api/me`** — the
  payload still sends `avatarUrl`, which now reads as `undefined` with no type error.
- Session is an **HttpOnly `sid` cookie** the backend sets. The SPA never sees a credential.
- `csrf` cookie (not HttpOnly, on purpose) is echoed as `X-CSRF-Token` on every non-safe
  method. `api/axios.ts` does this; a hand-rolled `fetch` POST gets a 403 `FORBIDDEN`.
- **The client cannot read its own session, so it must ask.** `GET /api/me` _is_ the session
  check. Never infer auth from `document.cookie`.
- **Never persist auth state to `localStorage`** — no tokens, no expiry, no "logged in" flag.
- A 401 is terminal (no refresh endpoint). `api/axios.ts` redirects to `/login`, except on
  `/api/me`, where `RequireAuth` owns the failure so `location.state.from` survives.
- Sign-in is a **full-page navigation** to `GET {API}/api/auth/google/login`, never `fetch` —
  XHR cannot follow the 302 and the user must see Google's origin in the address bar.
- There is **no `/auth/callback` route**; the backend redirects straight to the target path.
- `return_to` is **not currently wired**: `googleSignInUrl()` takes no argument, so a user
  bounced from a page lands on `/`. `RequireAuth` still records the path in
  `location.state.from`, so re-enabling means re-adding the parameter on both sides.
- Session: 12h absolute + 30m idle, sliding. Nothing to refresh, no client-side timer.
- All requests go through `api/client.ts`. No direct `fetch`/`axios` in components.

## Rules for humans / AI writing frontend code

- Server state lives in TanStack Query; don't duplicate it into Zustand or `useState`.
- Client state that more than one screen needs goes in a Zustand store; everything else
  stays local `useState`. There is exactly one store today (`SearchQuery`) — resist adding
  a second before two screens actually share its state.
- One `SearchQuery` drives all result views. No second copy.
- Select atomically from Zustand. A selector returning a fresh object fails the `Object.is`
  check on every write and re-renders every consumer.
- Every string goes through i18n. Every number goes through `lib/format.ts`.
- Mocks live in one place and are obviously mocks. Don't scatter fixtures through components.
- `components/ui/` is owned by the shadcn CLI and may be overwritten — override at the call
  site, don't edit in place. Retokenising to the palette above is the one allowed exception.
- A change to the data contracts above → update `src/types/` in the same commit.
- Follow `.claude/rules/typescript.md` (explicit `return`, block bodies) and
  `.claude/rules/commit.md` (never commit unless asked).
- Comments: sparingly, only where the logic isn't self-evident. Prefer clear names.

## Implementation checklist

Done (auth era, committed):

- [x] Vite + Tailwind 4 + Router + Query scaffold, `host: true`
- [x] 15 shadcn/ui `radix-nova` primitives, Geist font, theme wiring
- [x] Cookie-session auth: `api/{axios,client,endpoints,auth}.ts`, `lib/{csrf,errors,navigate}.ts`
- [x] LoginPage, RequireAuth, sign out, AppHeader/AppLayout, HomePage
- [x] `viewport-fit=cover`, 44px touch targets, dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme`

Blocked / needs input:

- [ ] **`02-component-breakdown.md` missing** — i18n keys and component props undefined
- [ ] **`03-database-analysis.md` missing** — no real API contract; everything is mocked
- [ ] Decide Be Vietnam Pro vs Geist (VI diacritic review)
- [ ] Decide the map SDK (R2)

R1, not started:

- [ ] Phase 1 — tokens, i18next, `lib/format.ts` + `lib/normalize.ts` with tests, icon set
- [ ] Phase 2 — AppShell + BottomNav, routes, R1 nav items disabled
- [ ] Phase 3 — Discover header, toolbar, PlaceCard list, infinite scroll
- [ ] Phase 4 — `searchStore` (`SearchQuery`), FilterSheet with live count, SortSheet
- [ ] Phase 5 — Location sheet: 3-level cascade + old-ward-name search
- [ ] Phase 7 — Place detail + media grid (viewer is R2)
- [ ] Phase 10a — EmptyState, LoadingState, QA checklist
- [ ] Retokenise `components/ui/` to the terracotta palette
- [ ] Trim initial JS from 183 KB to under the 170 KB budget
- [ ] Check every screen at 360/375/390/430px, VI and EN, light and dark
- [ ] Real-device QA: iOS Safari (latest, latest-1), mid-range Android Chrome, 4G throttling
